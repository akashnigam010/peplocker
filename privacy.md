# Privacy Policy

- Your are logged in Peplocker via your Google account and it uses your Google Drive to keep your notes data.
- Peplocker can not read any other data in your drive account, other than what it creates itself.
- Nothing gets stored locally - your notes data or your google account data
- You sign in with your password which is used as the key for a symmetric AES 256 bit encryption - an industry standard.
- When you update your notes, the data is encrypted in realtime and saved in your Google Drive account without being saved locally. This introduces a bit of delay while saving the changes, but improves security.
- When you switch between apps or lock your phone screen, Peplocker automatically logs you out.

This privacy policy will be updated in future.
